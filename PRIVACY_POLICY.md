**Effective Date:** February 26, 2026

Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at Agala ("we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us.

When you use our mobile application (the "App"), you trust us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy notice, we describe our privacy policy. We seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it and what rights you have in relation to it.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when registering at the App, expressing an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and services, or otherwise contacting us.

The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the App, the choices you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect can include the following:

- **Account Information:** When you create an account, we collect your email address and password for authentication purposes.
- **App Data:** We collect data related to your use of the App, including your shopping lists, custom items you create, and your purchase history. This data is essential to provide the core functionality of the App, including syncing across devices and providing smart shopping predictions.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use personal information collected via our App for a variety of business purposes described below. We process your personal information for these purposes in reliance on our legitimate business interests, in order to enter into or perform a contract with you, with your consent, and/or for compliance with our legal obligations.

We use the information we collect or receive:

- **To facilitate account creation and logon process.**
- **To provide and manage the App's core features:** This includes saving your shopping lists, syncing them across your devices, and sharing them with your family members or roommates if you choose to do so.
- **To improve our services:** We use your purchase history to provide smart AI predictions on when you might need to restock certain items.

## 3. Will Your Information Be Shared With Anyone?

We only share and disclose your information in the following situations:

- **Compliance with Laws:** We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
- **Vital Interests and Legal Rights:** We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
- **Third-Party Service Providers:** We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Specifically, we use **Supabase** for our backend database and authentication services.

We **do not** sell your personal information to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

## 4. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it.

## 5. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.

## 6. Your Privacy Rights

You have the right to review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
If you would like to delete your account and all associated data (including shopping lists and purchase history), you can do so directly within the App's settings or by contacting us. Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases.

## 7. Updates to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Effective Date" and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
